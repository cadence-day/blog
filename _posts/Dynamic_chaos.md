At times life feels completely exhilarating and exciting, usually it happens to me when there is a lot of changes and novel lifestyles being sampled..

At one point when I was living in New York and life was settling down into a very predictable routine, I began to wonder if it was possible to live in several places at the same time, to design a lifestyle where the traveling was built into the dynamic of life itself. That seemed exciting,moving between several worlds simultaneously, experiencing the life with the built-in unpredictability. 

Soon after these thoughts became concrete, the reality started to shift slightly, and I found myself presented with an opportunity to co-found my first startup. It just so happened the main partner and the investment came from Switzerland, and shortly thereafter I started visiting Zurich quite often during the setup of the company and negotiations period. 

The idea of living in more than one place started to take shape, and I moved closer to realizing the dreams I was dreaming in the not-so-distant past. I started moving between New York and Zurich, and somehow Istanbul was also thrown into the mix, since it was inexpensive and my co-founder and I were also linked to the space because of circumstance. 

The speed of the unfolding increased and soon I was taking a flight every two weeks moving between the cities. The reality of an international startup is the state of unpredictability and life started to be spent in Airbnbs and hotels, and that was super fun, and I enjoyed it very much. Glad it happened. 

When the company was in place there was a desire to settle down and create circumstances with stable bases, as opposed to floating apartments, and the need to change and plan all the time. 

Long story short, with all of the effort, I ended up setting up a system where I was keeping three apartments in the world in three different cities and was constantly moving between them on trains and planes. At that pace, on top of the work that was also fluid with hours fluctuating since we were managing a team spread across the US, Europe, and Australia, time and the organization of it became a big issue. 

Life was a blur, everything just blended together, with the memory playing tricks all the time, to the point that it was difficult to recall what happened last Tuesday, not only what happened but also where it all took place. The mind was scattered, the life scattered, my being was scattered, I felt that if I didn't have a system to keep track of time and organize, everything would just spin out of control. 

I couldn't use any system that was available and I tried several. Eventually I decided to create one myself, using a pen and pencil, and eventually Figma, because it offered the flexibility of the format and I could just invent my own layout and keep track of things that I wanted to keep track of. I accumulated a total of 120 sheets representing my days, at which point I realized that the system was established and it was working for me. 

Along the way I was starting to feel the burn out in that setup, so I eventually decided to shift gears and take a break from work and settle in one place in Berlin. 

After gaining control over my emotional state, I started wanting to work, because work is awesome, and it was just natural that I would continue with the system and use it in an attempt to create a product. 

The name Cadence captured accurately the nature of the product, since at times it feels that the cadence of the life is off and it needs to be brought back to the comfortable setting. 

The main idea with Cadence is to provide a system that guards against losing track, or at least if that happend to have a sytem that lets on get on track.

I have used our app every day since the first prototype, which was October of 2024, and I'm happy to report that life is so much more pleasant because of it.
