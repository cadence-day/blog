excerpt: "
The present moment is the opportunity to steer the story into the desired future. It is also worth recognizing the traces of the current circumstances in the past."

The importance of being in the present is a conventional wisdom that is firmly rooted in culture, and I fully agree with it. There are several thoughts I am currently trying to articulate regarding the meaning of the "present".

It feels like the 'seconds' view of time is not necessarily working here. The present is more like a state rather than a unit of time measurement, so attention should definitely reside in that state.

From the perspective of positioning oneself in the situation, it feels wise to never forget that life moves from the past into the future through the present.

Many aspects of the current circumstances were seeded somewhere in the past and will be echoed in the future. The present moment is the continuous opportunity to steer one's story into the desired circumstances, whatever those might be.

It sounds obvious, however this reminder on the nature of the experience has a tendency to adjust my behavior in the moment. It always inspires me to trace the seeds of the current situation in the past and pushes me to articulate the type of future I would like to walk toward.

Cadence dial over the last year has continuously brought me into the present. The reflection mode and recently added activity targets helped me understand and link the 'weekly present' to the overall trajectory as it continuously unfolds.

My current view on the 'present' is an opportunity to sort out all of the 'issues' of the past and to carefully act in line with the desired future.
